### work-wiki Phase Progress

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Phase 1: Schema evolution** | ✅ Complete | Extended frontmatter (confidence, expiry, valid_from, authors, contributors, sources, disputed, supersedes, aliases), type validation/coercion, entity dedup, 15 lint checks (10 with auto-fix), ingest pipeline wiring, SCHEMA.md updated |
| **Phase 2: Talk pages + attribution** | ✅ Built, surfaces retired | Discussion panel UI + API, contributor profiles with trust scores, threaded comments with nested replies, contributor badges on page view — all shipped, then every one of those product surfaces was cut with the move to the private, single-owner Workbench (`src/lib/retired.ts`). The `discuss/` storage format, the readers over it, the contributor profile library and revision attribution are unaffected. |
| **Phase 3: X ingestion loop** | ✅ Complete | Library function + API route + MCP tool (`ingest_x_mention`) complete — GitHub Actions polling workflow blocked on deployment architecture |
| **Phase 4: Agent identity** | ✅ Complete | Agent registry, seed, scoped search, context API, MCP server (40 tools), contributor profile library (the profiles still compute; the surfaces that rendered them were retired), agent CRUD — remaining: grow.sh migration, identity content migration |
| **Phase 5: Agent surface research** | ⬜ Not started | Structured claims, fact triples, embeddings experiments |

### Known tech debt

1. **No E2E browser tests** — Unit and integration tests are strong (9,672) but no Playwright/Cypress tests
2. **Contributor trust score** — Simple `edits / (edits + reverts)` ratio; needs validation against real multi-user data
3. **grow.sh still coupled to yoyo-evolve** — Downloads a tarball from a separate repo instead of using the work-wiki API it already has
4. **GitHub Actions polling workflow** — Phase 3 X-mention polling (#21) blocked on deployment architecture
